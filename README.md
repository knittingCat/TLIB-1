# TLIB

A single zsh script that installs small GitHub-hosted "command" repos as
executables on your `PATH`. Point it at a repo and it downloads, builds
if needed, and drops the command(s) into `~/cmds`.

## Disclaimer

`tlib` downloads and installs software written by other people from GitHub
repositories, then makes it runnable from your `PATH`. The `tlib` authors and
contributors do not write, review, audit, host, or endorse the packages you
install with it, and cannot guarantee that any of them is safe.

**Installing a package means running someone else's code on your computer.**
A package can contain malware, or code that is buggy, destructive, or
harmful in other ways, such as deleting or stealing files or credentials.
Only install packages from authors you trust, and read the repo first.

`tlib` is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the `tlib` authors and contributors
are not liable for any damage, data loss, security breach, or other harm
caused by any package you install with `tlib`, including malware, or by
`tlib` itself. You use `tlib` and everything installed with it at your own
risk.

## Setup

```bash
if [ ! -d "$HOME/cmds" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$HOME/cmds"
    printf '\nexport PATH="$HOME/cmds:$PATH"\n' >> "$HOME/.zshrc"
fi

TLIB_SRC="$HOME/.tlib-src"
if [ -d "$TLIB_SRC" ]; then
    (cd "$TLIB_SRC" && git pull)
else
    git clone https://github.com/BlueGrayFoo/TLIB.git "$TLIB_SRC"
fi
cd "$TLIB_SRC" || exit 1

chmod +x ZSH.zsh tlibUpdater
ln -sf "$(pwd)/ZSH.zsh" "$HOME/cmds/tlib"
ln -sf "$(pwd)/tlibUpdater" "$HOME/cmds/tlibUpdater"
```

`tlib` and `tlibUpdater` both are installed with that command. (`zsh`,
`curl`, `tar`, `python3` are all either needs, and macOS already has them.)

```bash
tlibUpdater update
```

pulls the latest `ZSH.zsh` from this repo and overwrites your installed
`tlib` with it (backing up the old one first as `<path>.bak`), or says
it's already up to date if nothing changed.

<details>
<summary>Only if `tlib doctor` warns about a missing compiler</summary>

Some repos build C/C++/Objective-C/Swift/Go/Rust source, which needs
`clang`/`clang++`/`swiftc`/`go`/`rustc`. Most repos don't need this —
`tlib doctor` just warns, it doesn't block installs without them.

```bash
xcode-select --install    # clang, clang++, swiftc
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y   # rustc

GOVER=$(curl -s 'https://go.dev/VERSION?m=text' | head -1)
ARCH=$(uname -m); [ "$ARCH" = "x86_64" ] && ARCH=amd64
curl -LO "https://go.dev/dl/$GOVER.darwin-$ARCH.tar.gz"
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf "$GOVER.darwin-$ARCH.tar.gz"
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/go/bin/go /usr/local/bin/go
rm -f "$GOVER.darwin-$ARCH.tar.gz"
```

(Go uses the tarball, not the `.pkg` installer — the `.pkg` refuses to run
on macOS versions older than 13.)

## Usage

```bash
tlib install RepoName          # or Owner/RepoName, or a github.com URL
tlib update RepoName           # reinstall only if the repo has new commits
tlib updateScan                # check every installed repo for new commits
tlib uninstall RepoName
tlib doctor                    # check dependencies
```

## Publishing your own repo

See [COMPLIANCE.md](COMPLIANCE.md) for the full checklist and every
possible error message decoded. Short version: add an `info.xml` to the
repo root:

```xml
<tlib version="1">
  <package name="my-tool" version="1.0.0">
    <requires>
      <tool name="node"/>
    </requires>
    <commands>
      <command name="my-tool" source="my-tool.js" language="node"/>
    </commands>
  </package>
</tlib>
```

`<requires>` lists tools that must already be on `PATH`. Each `<command>`
needs a `name` and a `source` file — tlib picks how to run it from the
file extension (or an explicit `language=`): shell scripts are copied
as-is, Python/Node/Ruby/etc. get wrapped in a shim that execs the right
interpreter, and C/C++/Objective-C/Swift/Go/Rust get compiled. A command
can also use `build="some shell command"` instead of `source`, if it
needs a build step first.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TLIB_INSTALL_DIR` | `~/cmds` | Where installed commands are copied |
| `TLIB_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.tlib` | Where repo downloads and install manifests live |
| `TLIB_DEFAULT_OWNER` | `Bluegrayfoo` | GitHub owner assumed when `install` is given a bare repo name |
| `TLIB_COLOR` | `always` | `never` disables colored progress output |

### All `install` forms

```
tlib install RepoName
tlib install Owner/RepoName
tlib install https://github.com/Owner/RepoName
tlib install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owner/RepoName/branch/
tlib install-owner Owner RepoName    # same as install Owner/RepoName
tlib update Owner/RepoName           # accepts the same specs as install
tlib updateScan --apply              # check everything, then update what's behind
tlib local /path/to/repo             # install from a local directory, no download
tlib --version
```

### How install works

`tlib install <spec>` downloads the repo's tarball into
`$TLIB_CACHE_DIR/repos/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>`, installs from `info.xml`
if present (else falls back to a legacy `make.sh` + `src/*` shape), copies
each resulting command into `$TLIB_INSTALL_DIR`, and writes a manifest to
`$TLIB_CACHE_DIR/installed/<owner>__<repo>` listing what it installed.
`tlib uninstall` just reads that manifest back and deletes those files.

The manifest also records the commit that was installed (looked up from
GitHub's API at install time). `tlib update <spec>` asks GitHub for the
branch's current commit, says "Already up to date" if it matches, and
otherwise downloads and installs again. A package installed before this
existed has no commit on record, so its first `update` always reinstalls
and records one.

`tlib updateScan` runs that check for every manifest in
`$TLIB_CACHE_DIR/installed` and prints one line per package: up to date,
update available, or no version on record. Nothing is changed unless you
pass `--apply`, which then runs `tlib update` on each package that has new
commits (packages with no recorded commit are listed but left alone, so a
scan never triggers a reinstall on its own).

Only public GitHub repos are supported — downloads use GitHub's
unauthenticated archive endpoint.

### `info.xml`, in full

Each `<command>` needs a `name` (or `id`; derived from `source`'s filename
if omitted) and one of `source`, `build`, or `output`:

- **`build`** — runs a shell command in the repo root, then looks for the
  resulting executable at `output` (if given) or by searching
  `<repo>/<name>`, `build/`, `dist/`, `bin/`, `.build/release/`,
  `.build/debug/`.
- **`output`** (no `source`) — the file's already built; used as-is.
- **`source`** — dispatched by `language` (or file extension):
  `c`/`cpp`/`c++` → clang/clang++; `objc`/`m` → clang with a framework
  from `frameworks` or auto-detected; `swift` → swiftc (extra files via
  `sources`); `shell`/`sh`/`bash`/`zsh` → copied as-is; `python`/`node`/
  `ruby`/`perl`/`php`/`lua` → wrapped in a shim exec'ing that interpreter
  (override with `interpreter`); `go` → `go build`; `rust` → `rustc`;
  `copy`/`binary`/`prebuilt` → copied as-is.

`args` passes extra flags to the compiler/build step. Paths in `source`,
`output`, and `sources` must stay inside the repo. Command names must be
unique and contain only alphanumerics, `.`, `_`, `+`, `-`. Most fields
accept a couple of aliases (e.g. `source`/`src`/`file`/`path`).

### Legacy repo shape

Used when there's no `info.xml`: a `make.sh` at the repo root, plus one or
more files under `src/` (command name = filename without extension).
`make.sh` runs first; if it didn't already produce a matching executable,
tlib compiles the source itself (a smaller language set than `info.xml`:
c/cc/cpp/cxx, m, swift, sh/zsh/bash, py, js/mjs, rb, pl, php, lua).
